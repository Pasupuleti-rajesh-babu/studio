## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable).**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up your Gemini API Key:**
    *   Obtain a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   Run the application (see next step).
    *   Click the **Key icon** in the header to open the API Key modal.
    *   Enter your API key and save. The key is stored locally in your browser's local storage. Without this key, AI features will be disabled.
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This usually starts the app on `http://localhost:9002`. (Note: Due to `basePath: "/habitlocal"`, you'll access it at `http://localhost:9002/habitlocal` during development).

## Building for Static Deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages)

1.  **Build the Next.js app:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Export to static HTML/CSS/JS:**
    ```bash
    npm run export
    ```
    This will generate the static site in the `/out` directory. Your app files will be under `/out/habitlocal/` due to the `basePath` setting.
3.  **Prepare for GitHub Pages:**
    *   **Create `404.html` Fallback:** For client-side routing to work correctly on GitHub Pages, you need a `404.html` file that is a copy of your main `index.html`. Since `basePath: "/habitlocal"` is used, your app's entry point is `out/habitlocal/index.html`.
        If you are deploying the entire `out` directory to the root of your `gh-pages` branch (or `docs` folder), the `404.html` file should also be at the root of that deployment.
        Execute this command from your project root after the `npm run export` step:
        ```bash
        cp out/habitlocal/index.html out/404.html
        ```
        This ensures that any unknown path is served `out/404.html` (which is actually your app's `index.html`), allowing Next.js router to take over.
    *   **`basePath` and Repository Name:** Your `next.config.ts` has `basePath: "/habitlocal"`.
        *   If your GitHub repository is named `habitlocal`, you'll access your site at `https://<username>.github.io/habitlocal/`.
        *   If your GitHub repository has a different name (e.g., `my-awesome-habits`), you **must** change `basePath` in `next.config.ts` to match that repository name (e.g., `basePath: "/my-awesome-habits"`) **before** running `npm run build` and `npm run export`. Then, you would access it at `https://<username>.github.io/my-awesome-habits/`.
4.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
    *   **Using `gh-pages` package:**
        Install `gh-pages` if you haven't:
        ```bash
        npm install gh-pages --save-dev
        # or
        # yarn add gh-pages --dev
        ```
        Then run (this deploys the contents of the `out` directory):
        ```bash
        npx gh-pages -d out
        ```
        This will push the contents of the `out` directory to a `gh-pages` branch and enable GitHub Pages if not already configured.
    *   **Manual commit to `docs` folder:**
        Alternatively, you can commit the contents of the `out` folder into a `/docs` directory on your `main` (or `master`) branch. Then, in your repository's GitHub settings, under "Pages", configure the source to be "Deploy from a branch" and select your `main` branch with the `/docs` folder.

## How AI Features Work (Client-Side)

The application leverages Google's Gemini models directly in the user's browser:

1.  **`@google/genai` SDK:** The official Google Generative AI SDK for JavaScript is used to make calls to the Gemini API.
2.  **Client-Side Wrapper (`src/lib/genai.ts`):** A simple wrapper function `runGemini(prompt)` is created. This function:
    *   Retrieves the user's Gemini API key from `localStorage` (set via the UI modal using the key `habitlocal_gemini_api_key`).
    *   Initializes the `GoogleGenerativeAI` client.
    *   Sends the constructed prompt to the "gemini-1.5-flash-latest" model.
    *   Returns the text response from the AI.
3.  **React Components:**
    *   AI-feature components (e.g., in `src/components/ai/`, `src/components/habits/`) construct specific prompts as strings.
    *   They call the `runGemini` function with these prompts.
    *   If the AI is expected to return JSON, the component's prompt instructs the AI to output JSON, and the component then parses the text response into a JavaScript object (with error handling and Zod validation).
    *   Components manage loading states, display results, and handle potential errors.
4.  **API Key Requirement:**
    *   AI features require a valid Gemini API key, stored by the user in their browser's local storage. If the key is missing or invalid, AI features will not work, and error messages will guide the user.

## Caveats of Static/Client-Side AI

*   **API Key Exposure:** The API key is stored in the user's browser and used directly in client-side requests. This is generally acceptable for personal use but not recommended for a public SaaS application where you would typically proxy API calls through a backend to protect your key.
*   **No Server-Side Logic:** All Next.js server features (SSR, API routes, server components that perform server-side tasks) are unavailable in a static export. The application is pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   **CORS:** The Google Gemini API endpoint must remain configured to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for requests from browsers. This is typically handled by Google.
