## Style Guidelines:

- Use dynamic system colors from the iOS palette (e.g., systemBlue) that adapt to light and dark modes, ensuring a native iOS look. In dark mode, use appropriate dark system colors.
- Use system background colors (e.g., systemBackground) for a seamless integration with iOS, automatically adjusting to light and dark appearances. Ensure proper contrast in dark mode.
- Utilize system accent colors (e.g., accentColor) to highlight completed habits and key actions, providing a consistent and recognizable iOS visual cue. Adjust accent colors for visibility in dark mode.
- Headline font: 'SF Pro Display' or 'SF Pro Text' (depending on the size) for headings, providing a clear, contemporary feel that aligns with Apple's design language. Body font: 'SF Pro Text'. Ensure readability in both light and dark modes.
- Use a set of minimalist glyph icons to represent each habit, adhering to iOS HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) for clarity and recognizability. The style should be modern and clean, similar to Apple's SF Symbols, ensuring consistency with native iOS icons. Adapt icon colors for dark mode to maintain visibility.
- Keep the layout clean and simple, using a card-based design to organize habits. Follow iOS HIG for spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy to ensure a native look and feel. Employ a subtle 'glassmorphism' effect for cards to create a frosted glass look, adding depth and a modern aesthetic, while maintaining legibility and accessibility. Ensure it is both mobile and desktop friendly. Adjust the glassmorphism effect for dark mode to maintain legibility.
- Implement advanced, subtle animations for user interactions, such as completing a habit or viewing statistics. Adhere to iOS HIG for animation duration and easing to maintain a smooth and fluid user experience. Use spring-based animations for a more natural and responsive feel. Integrate haptic feedback for key interactions to enhance the user experience, providing tactile confirmation and enhancing engagement. Optimize animations for performance in both light and dark modes.
